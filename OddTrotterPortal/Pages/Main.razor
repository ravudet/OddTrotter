            //// if the encryptor really can throw during encryption, then you should add unit tests for all of the consumers of that api to cover the cases where it throws
            //// you chose not to use blob storage for the todo list itself, only the timestamp, because the timestamp could sometimes lead you to either duplicating or leaving out events; if you store the timestamp *and* the event ID, this can probably be avoided
            //// don't overload exception messages

            //// create a memorycache interface for todolistservice to use that doesn't allow for null cache values; you should probably avoid imemorycache entirely: it doesn't document its exceptions and it throws quite a number of them

            //// should you use an enum for the issuedtoken tokentype? how would that work when new tokentypes are introduced? maybe have it be a string, but then have constant strings of the known token types? at this point, are the constants different from an enum? so maybe the property type is a string, but an enum is provided for clarity? how about teh enum  has an "unknown" and there's a string property *and* an enum property? maybe a nullable neum property then?

            //// in actorprovisioner, when we instantiate the actor object, we use a field that contains the tenant domain; we could instead get it from the publisherdomain property in the application creation response; this would guarantee that we have a *consistent* domain, but what if the initializer of the actorprovisioner wants to have actors that are *issued tokens* in a different domain? does that case even make sense? if it does, then does using the field as it currently is actually work for that?
            //// iprovisionedactor probably should not use idisposable; the implementations *are* able to throw exceptions, and idisposable gives the impression that we are managing memory; you should use the disposition pattern, but declare your own method
